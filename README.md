The code you've provided is a JavaScript class called InfinityScroll that appears to be designed for implementing infinite scrolling behavior on a web page. Infinite scrolling is a popular UX pattern where additional content is loaded as the user scrolls down a page. I'll provide an overview of how this class works:

Constructor:

The constructor takes several parameters:

target_element: The ID of the HTML element that triggers the infinite scrolling when it becomes visible in the viewport.
url: The URL for making AJAX requests to load more data.
callback: A callback function that generates HTML elements based on the data received from the server.
amount: The number of items to load in each request.
post_data (optional): Additional data to send in the POST request.
Inside the constructor, the class initializes various properties:

last_view: A timestamp to track when the target element was last seen.
count: A count of the items loaded so far.
amount: The number of items to load in each request.
observer: An IntersectionObserver that watches for when the target element becomes visible in the viewport.
The IntersectionObserver's callback function is defined to check if the target element is visible and whether a certain time interval (1 second in this case) has passed since it was last viewed. If both conditions are met, it calls the ServerCall method to load more data.

The constructor also sets the instance properties for url, callback, target_element, and post_data. It then starts observing the target element for intersection.

GenerateElements:

This method is responsible for processing the data received from the server and generating HTML elements based on that data.
It assumes that the server response is JSON and parses it.
It then iterates over the data and increments the count property for each item.
It uses the callback function to generate HTML elements and inserts them before the target element on the page.
If there is more data to load (i.e., the data array is not empty), it continues observing the target element for intersection, allowing for additional data to be loaded when the user scrolls.
ServerCall:

This method makes an AJAX (jQuery) POST request to the specified url.
It includes data such as count, amount, and post_data in the request payload.
Upon a successful response, it calls the GenerateElements method to process and display the newly loaded data.
Overall, this class provides a structure for implementing infinite scrolling by observing a target element and making AJAX requests to load and display additional content as the user scrolls down the page. The callback function plays a crucial role in generating HTML elements from the server's response data.
